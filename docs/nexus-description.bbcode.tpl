This mod allows increasing the cargo size of transports, mining ships, auxiliaries and carriers (including DLCs).

There are three cargo size variants to choose from:

[list]
[*]Cargo size x2
[*]Cargo size x4
[*]Cargo size x10
[/list]
All ship sizes (S / M / L / XL) will be adjusted, for both NPC and player ships. 

Existing and new ships will receive the adjusted values.

As optional downloads, you can choose ship types to adjust separately, which allows mixing cargo multipliers (Transport ships x2 and mining ships x10 for example).

Available ship type downloads:

[*]Mining Ships
[*]Transport Ships
[*]Auxiliaries
[*]Carriers
