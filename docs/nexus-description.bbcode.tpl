This mod allows increasing the cargo size of transports, mining ships, auxiliaries and carriers (including DLCs).

There are several cargo size variants to choose from:

[list]
[*]Cargo size x2
[*]Cargo size x4
[*]Cargo size x6
[*]Cargo size x8
[*]Cargo size x10
[/list]
All ship sizes (S / M / L / XL) will be adjusted for both NPC and player ships. Existing and new ships will receive the adjusted values.

[b]NOTE:[/b] To compensate for the increased mass ships can carry with the increased cargo holds, the flight characteristics of the ships (acceleration, speed, turning) are also adjusted. This guarantees that even with a full cargo hold, the ships can still be flown normally.

If you want more control over the cargo sizes, use the FOMOD installer version available in the downloads. This lets you choose the cargo size for each ship class and size combination.

For example, Transports (S) x2, Transports (M) x4, Mining Ships (L) x10, etc.

[b][color=#d9ead3][size=3]UninstallingðŸ”¸[/size][/color][/b]

The mod can be uninstalled at any time. Ships will retain their cargo even if it exceeds their cargo capacity after removing the mod, so no cargo is lost.

[b][color=#d9ead3][size=3]VRO compatibilityðŸ”¸[/size][/color][/b]

The mod has [b]not been tested with VRO[/b]. As I personally do not use VRO, I cannot guarantee that it will work. I am open to creating a patch for VRO if one is needed, and if you can provide information on the required changes.

[b][color=#d9ead3][size=3]Possible ConflictsðŸ”¸[/size][/color][/b]

As the mod changes the flight characteristics of ships, it will conflict with mods that also change them. As other mods are unlikely to compensate for the cargo mass increase, I have set my mod to high priority. This should ensure that my mod's flight characteristics are used. If not, you will possibly experience some ships that are too slow or have poor acceleration.
