This mod allows increasing the cargo size of transports, mining ships, auxiliaries and carriers (including DLCs).

There are three cargo size variants to choose from:

[list]
[*]Cargo size x2
[*]Cargo size x4
[*]Cargo size x10
[/list]
All ship sizes (S / M / L / XL) will be adjusted for both NPC and player ships. Existing and new ships will receive the adjusted values.

If you want more control over the cargo sizes, use the FOMOD installer version available in the downloads. This lets you choose the cargo size for each ship class and size combination.

For example, Transports (S) x2, Transports (M) x4, Mining Ships (L) x10, etc.
